# Cheap Flight Deals 
API's to get the best flight deals and let users know when they are available via SMTP 

<h2> About </h2> 
Uses the Kiwi / Tequila API to check for the cheapest flight destinations ( by reading a Google Sheet via the Sheety API ) within the next 6 months for a selection of flights. If a cheaper flight is found than the limit, the user recieves an email for that flight. 

v2.0 Intended Features
<ul>
  <li> Allow other users to track their own flights / arrange for emails / notifications </li>
<li> Will be one email summarising the flights available / when as opposed to 1 per email as it clogs up user email inbox</li>
<li> Will keep a record of cheapest flight found and compare current cheap flight vs historical low etc.
</ul>

Functional? 
Not currently. 
Current bug investigation - limited by API usage ( working on few projects so happy to jump between rather than create endless burner emails )
